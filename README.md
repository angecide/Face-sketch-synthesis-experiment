# Face-sketch-synthesis-experiment

A course project in deep learning that explored the effects of different architectural ways of constructing a generative adversarial network. The main purpose of this project was to use the model presented in the paper "Semi-Supervised Learning for Face Sketch Synthesis in the Wild"  [[1]](#1) and tweak the construction of the generative model in order to observe the effects the models had on the sketches that were synthesized.
